      review: "I had two implants and full mouth rehabilitation done by Dr Shruti recently. It was a really amazing experience as she led the entire process with such care and efficiency. I was explained everything and the total process was impeccable and seamless. The staff assisting her and the other junior docs with her are equally efficient. I strongly recommend her clinic and infact a few of my acquaintances have already got some dental procedures done at her clinic. They are equally gushing about it. Big thumbs up to Veda!"
